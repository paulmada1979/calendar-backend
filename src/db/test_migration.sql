-- Test script to verify the migration works correctly
-- Run this after the migration to test the new tables

-- Test 1: Check if tables exist
SELECT 
  table_name,
  table_type
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'google_calendar_connections',
    'user_preferences', 
    'user_timelines',
    'calendar_events'
  )
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Test 2: Check table structure for user_timelines
\d+ user_timelines

-- Test 3: Check if the timezone_offset column exists and has correct type
SELECT 
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'user_timelines'
  AND column_name = 'timezone_offset';

-- Test 4: Check if indexes were created
SELECT 
  indexname,
  tablename,
  indexdef
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename = 'user_timelines'
ORDER BY indexname;

-- Test 5: Check if triggers were created
SELECT 
  trigger_name,
  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public' 
  AND event_object_table = 'user_timelines';

-- Test 6: Try to insert a test record (this will test the structure)
-- Note: This will fail if there's no auth.users table, but that's expected
-- The important thing is that the syntax is correct
DO $$

  -- This will fail due to foreign key constraint, but syntax should be valid
